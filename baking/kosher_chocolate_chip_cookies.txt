Ingredients:

2 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup dark brown sugar, packed
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vanilla
2 1/2 cups flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups best-quality chocolate chips, the smaller the better
Preparation:

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Using an electric mixer, beat the eggs and sugars together until light and fluffy. Add the oil and vanilla and mix in thoroughly. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt and mix at low speed. Fold in the chips by hand.
3. Drop the dough by heaping teaspoonfuls 1 inch apart onto cookie sheets lined with foil. Bake only one tray at a time. If your cookie sheets are the professional heavy-gauge type, bake the cookies for 10 minutes. If they are lighter, bake for 8 minutes. The cookies will firm up as they cool, so do not be tempted to bake them longer or they will harden.
4. Store the cookies in tin boxes, separating each layer with foil or wax paper so they don't stick.

YIELDS: 4 dozen cookies

NOTES:
1. If using pareve chocolate chips, the cookies will pareve. If using dairy chocolate chips, the cookies will be dairy.
2. I sprayed my cookie sheets with non-stick spray instead of using foil. It is less expensive, and the cookies could still be easily lifted off the sheet with a spatula.
3. I did not separate the cookies with wax paper before storing. I let them cool completely on the rack, and then placed them in an air-tight container. They did not stick to each other.
